        [SIR JOHN _and_ LADY CAROLINE PONTEFRACT, MISS WORSLEY, _on chairs under
        large yew tree</h4>
        <h6>LADY CAROLINE.</h6> <p>I am not sure, Miss Worsley, that foreigners like
        yourself should cultivate likes or dislikes about the people they are
        invited to meet. Mrs. Allonby is very well born. She is a niece of Lord
        Brancaster’s. It is said, of course, that she ran away twice before she
        was married. But you know how unfair people often are. I myself don’t
        believe she ran away more than once.</p>

        <h6>HESTER.</h6> <p>Mr. Arbuthnot is very charming.</p>

        <h6>LADY CAROLINE.</h6> <p>Ah, yes! the young man who has a post in a bank. Lady
        Hunstanton is most kind in asking him here, and Lord Illingworth seems to
        have taken quite a fancy to him. I am not sure, however, that Jane is
        right in taking him out of his position. In my young days, Miss Worsley,
        one never met any one in society who worked for their living. It was not
        considered the thing.</p>

        <h6 class="name">HESTER.</h6> <p class="speech">In America those are the people we respect most.</p>

        <h6 class="name">LADY CAROLINE.</h6> <p class="speech">I have no doubt of it.</p>

        <h6 class="name">HESTER.</h6> <p class="speech">Mr. Arbuthnot has a beautiful nature! He is so simple, so
        sincere. He has one of the most beautiful natures I have ever come
        across. It is a privilege to meet _him_.</p>

        <h6>LADY CAROLINE.</h6> <p>It is not customary in England, Miss Worsley, for a young
        lady to speak with such enthusiasm of any person of the opposite sex.
        English women conceal their feelings till after they are married. They
        show them then.</p>

        <h6>HESTER.</h6> <p>Do you, in England, allow no friendship to exist between a young
        man and a young girl?</p>

        [_Enter_ LADY HUNSTANTON, _followed by Footman with shawls and a
        cushion_.]

        LADY CAROLINE. We think it very inadvisable. Jane, I was just saying
        what a pleasant party you have asked us to meet. You have a wonderful
        power of selection. It is quite a gift.

        LADY HUNSTANTON. Dear Caroline, how kind of you! I think we all do fit
        in very nicely together. And I hope our charming American visitor will
        carry back pleasant recollections of our English country life. [_To
        Footman_.] The cushion, there, Francis. And my shawl. The Shetland.
        Get the Shetland. [_Exit Footman for shawl_.]

        [_Enter_ GERALD ARBUTHNOT.]

        GERALD. Lady Hunstanton, I have such good news to tell you. Lord
        Illingworth has just offered to make me his secretary.

        LADY HUNSTANTON. His secretary? That is good news indeed, Gerald. It
        means a very brilliant future in store for you. Your dear mother will be
        delighted. I really must try and induce her to come up here to-night.
        Do you think she would, Gerald? I know how difficult it is to get her to
        go anywhere.

        GERALD. Oh! I am sure she would, Lady Hunstanton, if she knew Lord
        Illingworth had made me such an offer.

        [_Enter Footman with shawl_.]

        LADY HUNSTANTON. I will write and tell her about it, and ask her to come
        up and meet him. [_To Footman_.] Just wait, Francis. [_Writes
        letter_.]

        LADY CAROLINE. That is a very wonderful opening for so young a man as
        you are, Mr. Arbuthnot.

        GERALD. It is indeed, Lady Caroline. I trust I shall be able to show
        myself worthy of it.

        LADY CAROLINE. I trust so.

        GERALD. [_To_ HESTER.] _You_ have not congratulated me yet, Miss
        Worsley.

        HESTER. Are you very pleased about it?

        GERALD. Of course I am. It means everything to me—things that were out
        of the reach of hope before may be within hope’s reach now.

        HESTER. Nothing should be out of the reach of hope. Life is a hope.

        LADY HUNSTANTON. I fancy, Caroline, that Diplomacy is what Lord
        Illingworth is aiming at. I heard that he was offered Vienna. But that
        may not be true.

        LADY CAROLINE. I don’t think that England should be represented abroad
        by an unmarried man, Jane. It might lead to complications.

        LADY HUNSTANTON. You are too nervous, Caroline. Believe me, you are too
        nervous. Besides, Lord Illingworth may marry any day. I was in hopes he
        would have married lady Kelso. But I believe he said her family was too
        large. Or was it her feet? I forget which. I regret it very much. She
        was made to be an ambassador’s wife.

        LADY CAROLINE. She certainly has a wonderful faculty of remembering
        people’s names, and forgetting their faces.

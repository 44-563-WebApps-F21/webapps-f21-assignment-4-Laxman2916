        <p class="stage-direction">[SIR JOHN _and_ LADY CAROLINE PONTEFRACT, MISS WORSLEY, _on chairs under
            large yew tree</p>
        <h6 class="name">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>
        <p class="speech caroline">I am not sure, Miss Worsley, that foreigners like
            yourself should cultivate likes or dislikes about the people they are
            invited to meet. Mrs. Allonby is very well born. She is a niece of Lord
            Brancaster’s. It is said, of course, that she ran away twice before she
            was married. But you know how unfair people often are. I myself don’t
            believe she ran away more than once.</p>

        <h6 class="name">HESTER.</h6>
        <p class="speech hester">Mr. Arbuthnot is very charming.</p>

        <h6 class="name">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>
        <p class="speech caroline">Ah, yes! the young man who has a post in a bank. Lady
            Hunstanton is most kind in asking him here, and Lord Illingworth seems to
            have taken quite a fancy to him. I am not sure, however, that Jane is
            right in taking him out of his position. In my young days, Miss Worsley,
            one never met any one in society who worked for their living. It was not
            considered the thing.</p>

        <h6 class="HESTER">HESTER.</h6>
        <p class="speech hester">In America those are the people we respect most.</p>

        <h6 class="name">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>
        <p class="speech caroline">I have no doubt of it.</p>

        <h6 class="HESTER">HESTER.</h6>
        <p class="speech hester">Mr. Arbuthnot has a beautiful nature! He is so simple, so
            sincere. He has one of the most beautiful natures I have ever come
            across. It is a privilege to meet _him_.</p>

        <h6 class="name">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>
        <p class="speech caroline">It is not customary in England, Miss Worsley, for a young
            lady to speak with such enthusiasm of any person of the opposite sex.
            English women conceal their feelings till after they are married. They
            show them then.</p>

        <h6 class="HESTER">HESTER.</h6>
        <p class="speech hester">Do you, in England, allow no friendship to exist between a young
            man and a young girl?</p>

        <p class="stahge-direction">[_Enter_ LADY HUNSTANTON, _followed by Footman with shawls and a
            cushion_.]</p>

        <h6 class="name">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>
        <p class="speech caroline">We think it very inadvisable. Jane, I was just saying
            what a pleasant party you have asked us to meet. You have a wonderful
            power of selection. It is quite a gift.</p>

        <h6 class="name">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>
        <p class="speech hunstanton">Dear Caroline, how kind of you! I think we all do fit
            in very nicely together. And I hope our charming American visitor will
            carry back pleasant recollections of our English country life.</p>
        <p class="stage-direction">[_To
            Footman_.]</p>
        <p class="speech">The cushion, there, Francis. And my shawl. The Shetland.
            Get the Shetland.</p>
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Exit Footman for shawl_.]</p>

        <p class="stage-direction">[_Enter_ GERALD ARBUTHNOT.]</p>

        <h6 class="name">GERALD.</h6>
        <p class="speech gerald">Lady Hunstanton, I have such good news to tell you. Lord
            Illingworth has just offered to make me his secretary.</p>

        <h6 class="name">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>
        <p class="speech hunstanton">His secretary? That is good news indeed, Gerald. It
            means a very brilliant future in store for you. Your dear mother will be
            delighted. I really must try and induce her to come up here to-night.
            Do you think she would, Gerald? I know how difficult it is to get her to
            go anywhere.</p>

        <h6 class="name">GERALD.</h6>
        <p class="speech gerald">Oh! I am sure she would, Lady Hunstanton, if she knew Lord
            Illingworth had made me such an offer.</p>

        <p class="stage-direction">[_Enter Footman with shawl_.]</p>

        <h6 class="name">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>
        <p class="speech hunstanton">I will write and tell her about it, and ask her to come
            up and meet him.</p>
        <p class="stage-direction">[_To Footman_.]</p>
        <p class="speech">Just wait, Francis.</p>
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Writes
            letter_.]</p>

        <h6 class="name">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>
        <p class="speech caroline">That is a very wonderful opening for so young a man as
            you are, Mr. Arbuthnot.</p>

        <h6 class="name">GERALD.</h6>
        <p class="speech gerald">It is indeed, Lady Caroline. I trust I shall be able to show
            myself worthy of it.</p>

        <h6 class="name">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>
        <p class="speech caroline">I trust so.</p>

        <h6 class="name">GERALD.</h6>
        <p class="stage-direction">[_To_ HESTER.]</p>
        <p class="speech gerald">_You_ have not congratulated me yet, Miss
            Worsley.</p>

        <h6 class="HESTER">HESTER.</h6>
        <p class="speech hester">Are you very pleased about it?</p>

        <h6 class="name">GERALD.</h6>
        <p class="speech gerald">Of course I am. It means everything to me—things that were out
            of the reach of hope before may be within hope’s reach now.</p>

        <h6 class="HESTER">HESTER.</h6>
        <p class="speech hester">Nothing should be out of the reach of hope. Life is a hope.</p>

        <h6 class="name">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>
        <p class="speech hunstanton">I fancy, Caroline, that Diplomacy is what Lord
            Illingworth is aiming at. I heard that he was offered Vienna. But that
            may not be true.</p>

        <h6 class="name">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>
        <p class="speech caroline">I don’t think that England should be represented abroad
            by an unmarried man, Jane. It might lead to complications.</p>

        <h6 class="name">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>
        <p class="speech hunstanton">You are too nervous, Caroline. Believe me, you are too
            nervous. Besides, Lord Illingworth may marry any day. I was in hopes he
            would have married lady Kelso. But I believe he said her family was too
            large. Or was it her feet? I forget which. I regret it very much. She
            was made to be an ambassador’s wife.</p>

        <h6 class="name">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>
        <p class="speech caroline">She certainly has a wonderful faculty of remembering
            people’s names, and forgetting their faces.</p>

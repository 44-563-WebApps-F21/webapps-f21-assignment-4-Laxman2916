    <h4 class="name">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h4>  <p class="speech hustantion">Well, that is very natural, Caroline, is it not?</p>  <p class="stage-direction">[_To
Footman_.]</p>  <p>Tell Henry to wait for an answer.  I have written a line to
your dear mother, Gerald, to tell her your good news, and to say she
really must come to dinner.</p>

    <h4 class="name">GERALD.</h4>   <p class="speech gerald">That is awfully kind of you, Lady Hunstanton</p>.  <p class="stage-direction">[_To_ HESTER.]</p>
<p>Will you come for a stroll, Miss Worsley?</p>

<h4 class="name">HESTER.</h4>  <p class= "speech hester">With pleasure.</p>  <p class="stage-direction">[_Exit with_ GERALD.]</p>

<h4 class="name">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h4>  <p class="speech hunstanton"></p>I am very much gratified at Gerald Arbuthnot’s good
fortune.  He is quite a _protégé_ of mine.  And I am particularly pleased
that Lord Illingworth should have made the offer of his own accord
without my suggesting anything.  Nobody likes to be asked favours.  I
remember poor Charlotte Pagden making herself quite unpopular one season,
because she had a French governess she wanted to recommend to every one.</p>

<h4 class="name">LADY CAROLINE.</h4>   <p class="speech caroline">I saw the governess, Jane.  Lady Pagden sent her to me.
It was before Eleanor came out.  She was far too good-looking to be in
any respectable household.  I don’t wonder Lady Pagden was so anxious to
get rid of her.</p>

<h4 class="name">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h4> <p class="speech hunstanton">Ah, that explains it.</p>
